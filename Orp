To create a new orphan branch 
"git checkout --orphan <branchname>"
We have a branch without parent 

We need to push some file 
echo  "This is an orphan branch" > test.txt
git commit -m  "Orphanbranch"
git push origin <OrphanBranchName> 

We need to switch our branch 
git checkout main
and merge  it by using git merge  <orphanBranchName>
and we get  "refusing to merge unrelated histories"

The orphan branch does not have common history witch main branch.
We can still merge an orphan branch by allow unrelated histories to be merged.

git merge <OrphanBranchName> -- allow-unrelated-histories
